* Initial release:
  - Basic GNU autotools project to build a library containing a TCTI
    implementation.
  - Simple skeleton for a TCTI library. All functions currently return
    TSS2_TCTI_RC_NOT_IMPLEMENTED. Those wishing to implement a TCTI for some
    transport should use this as a starting point and fill in the required
    functions.
  - Two headers are provided: one that is installed onto the host system
    (make install) for use by client applications, the other hosts our
    specific TCTI structure and any other data specific to the TCTI that
    should not be installed.
  - Example unit tests are provided in the test/ directory. These test the
    basic initialization of the TCTI structure.
