This is a skeleton for a library that provides a TPM command transmission
interface (TCTI). If you have a need to implement a TCTI for sending TPM2
commands over some new transport (shared memory, system bus, carrier pigeon)
the code in this repository may be a useful starting point. But as always,
YMMV.
