This is an implementation of a TPM command transmission interface (TCTI).
It is designed for use within an software guard extensions (SGX) enclave.
The SGX TCTI provides a mechanism for transporting TPM commands across the
enclave boundary. The application hosting the enclave is responsible for
propagating these commands to the the TPM.
